# PP_Introduction_to_Beautiful_Soup
A simple repository where I try to learn how to web scrape with beautiful soup

# Getting started
In order to install beautiful soup, run this command in bash:
```Shell
vagrant@ubuntu-focal:~/PP_Introduction_to_Beautiful_Soup$ pip install beautifulsoup4
```
```Shell
vagrant@ubuntu-focal:~/PP_Introduction_to_Beautiful_Soup$ pip install lxml
```
```Shell
vagrant@ubuntu-focal:~/PP_Introduction_to_Beautiful_Soup$ pip install requests
```

# Task 1
For this problem, the goal is to extract the pals and their categories for a website and then
write them onto a JSON file.

The results have been written onto this simple json file: `pal_categories.json`.
**Sample output**
```JSON
],
  "Legendary": [
    "Frostallion",
    "Frostallion Noct",
    "Jetragon",
    "Paladius",
    "Necromus"
  ]
```
There's more to be done. :D
